<p>
Ivan Yuri “Lion” De Leon is a Master’s student in Data Science at Ateneo de Manila University, where he focuses on AI, language, and human experience. He graduated Summa Cum Laude in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Economics and received the Mulry Award, the university’s highest distinction for literary excellence and service. He has also pursued advanced AI training through online courses in AI/LLM Engineering at PSI AI Academy, gaining hands-on experience in reasoning models, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic systems.
</p>

<p>
In AI and data science, Lion has gained practical experience through internships at a leading local bank and a major conglomerate, working on projects from predictive analytics to customer behavior modeling. He has also contributed to research as a research assistant at Ateneo de Manila University, supporting work in graph theory, and at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Japan, exploring human-AI interaction. He is currently a graduate assistant for the Mathematics and Environmental Science departments at Ateneo.
</p>

<p>
His interest in AI bridges into language through Filipino NLP and LLMs, which are central to his research. This commitment to language also extends into literature beyond his technical work. During his undergraduate years, he served as Managing Editor for Finance at HEIGHTS Ateneo, the university’s official literary publication, where he helped sustain a community centered on writing and creative expression while overseeing the organization’s financial operations.
</p>

<p>
As a person, he advocates for AI safety and Filipino intellectualization. He is also a published poet who writes about machines and human experience in Filipino. He worries that AI could one day move beyond human control, and that by helping build it, he is also helping build that risk. Still, he reminds himself that he can only do what he knows best—being human: to understand these systems, build them carefully, and act responsibly.
