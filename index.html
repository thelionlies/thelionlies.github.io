<p>
Ivan Yuri “Lion” De Leon is a Master’s student in Data Science at Ateneo de Manila University, where he focuses on understanding complex systems through data. He graduated Summa Cum Laude in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Economics, and was awarded the Mulry Award, the university’s highest distinction for literary excellence and service. He has also pursued advanced AI training through online courses in AI/LLM Engineering at PSI AI Academy, gaining hands-on experience in reasoning models, retrieval-augmented generation, agentic systems, and deployment of AI applications.
</p>

<p>
Lion has gained practical experience through internships at a leading local bank and a major conglomerate, working on projects ranging from predictive analytics to customer behavior modeling. He has also contributed to research as a graduate assistant at Ateneo de Manila University, supporting work in graph theory, and at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Japan, exploring human-AI interaction. Beyond research, he served as Managing Editor for Finance at HEIGHTS Ateneo, the university’s official literary publication, blending analytical rigor with communication and editorial leadership.
</p>

<p>
He worries that AI could one day move beyond human control, and that by helping build it, he is also helping build that risk. Still, he reminds himself that he can only do what he knows best—being human.
</p>

<p>
So he tries to understand these systems. He tries to build them carefully. He tries to act responsibly. Because he wants to prevent a future in which the very machines he helped create might stop him from doing what he knows best—being human.
