<p>
Láyon is a published poet with an unhealthy fascination for the intersections of machines and humans. Their work explores the ways technology and consciousness intersect, reflecting a deep curiosity about the posthuman condition.
</p>

His poetry has appeared in HEIGHTS, Ateneo’s literary publication, where he also served as Managing Editor, as well as in TLDTD and the Pambansang Hamon ng Pagtula winner compilation of San Anselmo Press, having won in both 2024 and 2025. He is an active member of Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo (LIRA).
</p>

<p>
He has also honed his craft through multiple workshops, including Palihang LIRA (2022, 2020), Ateneo HEIGHTS Workshop (2022), Cavite Young Writers’ Workshop (2021), and PETA Lingap Sining Spoken Word Poetry Workshop (2020).

Akala ni Láyon matematika na ang mapapangasawa niya. Ngunit ng makilala ang pagtula, hindi na mabuo-buo ang kanyang isip. Hanggang ngayon, hinahanap niya pa rin ang sariling layon.
