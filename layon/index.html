<p>
<strong>Láyon</strong> is a published poet whose work dwells on an uneasy fascination with the confluence of machines and humans. Their poetry interrogates the tensions between intelligent systems and the lived human experience of coexisting alongside them, as well as the shifting contours of the posthuman condition.
</p>

<p>
They hold a degree in Applied Mathematics from Ateneo de Manila University, where they received the Mulry Award for Literary Excellence and the Ateneo College Awards for the Arts in Poetry. They are also a recipient of the National Youth Achievement in Literary Arts, conferred by the National Committee on Literary Arts.
</p>

<p>
Their poems have appeared in HEIGHTS, Ateneo’s literary publication, where they also served as Managing Editor. Their work has likewise been featured in the literary journal TLDTD and in the Pambansang Hamon sa Pagtula anthology published by San Anselmo Press, where they were recognized as a winner in both 2024 and 2025. They are an active member of Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo (LIRA).
</p>

<p>
They have further honed their craft through several workshops, including Palihang LIRA (2020, 2022), the Ateneo HEIGHTS Workshop (2022), the Cavite Young Writers’ Workshop (2021), and the PETA Lingap Sining Spoken Word Poetry Workshop (2020).

<p>
Akala ni Láyon matematika ang kanyang mapapangasawa. Ngunit nang makilala niya ang pagtula, hindi na muling nabuo ang kanyang isip. Hanggang ngayon, hinahanap pa rin niya ang sariling layon.
