<hr>

<p>
Láyon is a published poet with an unhealthy fascination with the confluence of machines and humans. Their work explores the ways technology and consciousness intersect, showing deep curiosity about the posthuman condition.
</p>

<p>
They hold a degree in Applied Mathematics from Ateneo de Manila University, where they were awarded the Mulry Award for Literary Excellence and the Ateneo College Awards of the Arts in Poetry. They are also a recipient of the National Youth Achievement in Literary Arts, awarded by the National Committee on Literary Arts.
</p>

<p>
Their poetry has appeared in HEIGHTS, Ateneo’s literary publication, where they also served as Managing Editor, as well as in TLDTD and the Pambansang Hamon ng Pagtula winner compilation of San Anselmo Press, having won in both 2024 and 2025. They are an active member of Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo (LIRA).
</p>

<p>
They have also honed their craft through multiple workshops, including Palihang LIRA (2022, 2020), Ateneo HEIGHTS Workshop (2022), Cavite Young Writers’ Workshop (2021), and PETA Lingap Sining Spoken Word Poetry Workshop (2020).
</p>

<p>
Akala ni Láyon matematika na ang mapapangasawa niya. Ngunit ng makilala ang pagtula, hindi na mabuo-buo ang kanyang isip. Hanggang ngayon, hinahanap niya pa rin ang sariling layon.
