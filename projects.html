    <a href="https://github.com/thelionlies/TDR-LSTM-based-autoencoders" target="_blank">TDR LSTM Based Autoencoders</a>
    This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a technical paper for experiments on Tagalog Diacritic Restoration (TDR) using LSTM-based autoencoders. The dataset is based on articles from the Sari-Samot blogs by Filipino NA Virgilio Almario, which has diacritized homographs.

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/thelionlies/TDR-transformer-based-models" target="_blank">TDR Transformer Based Models</a>
    Partial codes for the thesis project focused on improving Tagalog diacritic restoration using corpus expansion, linguistic analysis, and transformer-based models.

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/thelionlies/fies-viewer" target="_blank">FIES Viewer</a>
    A Django-based web application for exploring and analyzing household economic data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) in the CALABARZON Region, Philippines. This project was developed for the Programming with Databases course in the MDSc program at Ateneo de Manila University.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/thelionlies/SIMS-Social-Impact-Mapping-Simulation" target="_blank">SIMS: Social Impact Mapping Simulation</a>
    A Java-based two-party election simulation implementing principles of Social Impact Theory (Nowak, Szamrej, &amp; Latané, 1990). This project was developed for the Programming with Databases class in MDSc at Ateneo de Manila University. It showcases a simple GUI, basic Java programming concepts, and simulation of social influence dynamics in a two-party election scenario.
